# Sentiment Analysis

# Abstract
Analysis of consumer reviews posted on social media is found to be essential for
several business applications. Consumer reviews posted in social media are
increasing at an exponential rate both in terms of number and relevance, which
leads to big data. In this project, a hybrid approach of two deep learning
architectures namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) (RNN with memory) is suggested for sentiment classification of
reviews posted at diverse domains. Deep convolutional networks have been highly
effective in local feature selection, while recurrent networks (LSTM) often yield
good results in the sequential analysis of a long text. The proposed Co-LSTM model
is mainly aimed at two objectives in sentiment analysis. First, it is highly adaptable
in examining big social data, keeping scalability in mind, and secondly, unlike the
conventional machine learning approaches, it is free from any particular domain.
The experiment has been carried out on three review datasets to train the model
which can handle all kinds of dependencies that usually arises in a post. The
experimental results show that the proposed ensemble model outperforms other
machine learning approaches in terms of accuracy and other parameters.

# Motivation

The motivation regarding the research work may be
outlined as follow:
In the present world of digitization, social platforms
available on the internet is a large origin of customer
relationship and reviews. Sentiment analysis of such a
large amount of data helps to find out and trail customer
opinion about brands, services, or goods Customer

feedback is crucially required in the process of decision-
making. For example, customer reviews about an e-
commerce goods can help a new customer to determine

on the product before purchasing it. The same technique
is also helpful for movie reviews, as they assist users in
determining the movie for viewing. Also, for business,
one can study the sentiments of a particular brand or goods
in specific demographic locations to find out the
prospective customers or the business probable of the new
goods or service in that location. Thus, the sentiment
analysis assist to increase the business of an organization.
Likewise, there are many applications of Sentiment
Analysis, which are useful in our day-to-day tasks
